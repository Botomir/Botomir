    <p class="align-text-left about-description-padding">
        Botomir is a Discord Bot written in Javascript. They were born on November 25, 2020, and was a happy
        accident more than a planned project. Botomir was created because he is a remedy to loneliness. It can be
        just you and Botomir, they won't tell.

        Botomir loves to eat chicken and waffles, washing it down with a Four loco, and cookies for dessert. Their
        favourite song is the windows startup sound. Their hobbies include going on long scrolls through Wikipedia,
        watching the sunset on YouTube, and snuggling up with the CPU on a cold night. Botomir's favourite tv show
        is Mr. Robot, and their favourite movie is 2001: A Space Odyssey.

        Botomir also loves to play. Feel free to ask them a command, they don't wear a shirt, but still has plenty
        of tricks up their sleeve. Botomir likes it when you call them a good bot, and also kinda likes it when you
        call them a bad bot.

                        Hello, and welcome to Botomir! This project originally because I wanted to add fun features
                        to a server I shared with some friends. Ever since then its grown and gained tons of cool
                        features. I loved seeing the application evolve, adding to new pieces, and watching it take
                        shape. We have big plans for the future of Botomir, and we are constantly in an effort to
                        improve it. If you notice any bugs or what to request features, please feel free to contact
                        us.

                        Botomir taught me a ton about application development and I'm very proud of what we've built.
                        This includes a greater understanding of MongoDB, JavaScript, and how to reliably deploy web
                        applications. I love creating and building things that people love to use, so I am
                        constantly working on side projects. If you have any questions, or would like to learn more
                        about me, please take a look at my website.

                    Hey, I started working on Botomir because "why not do one more little project?"
                    I love the idea of having one big super configurable bot for the server that can
                    do all the things, so I started making all the things.

                    I think that <i>slight</i> missquote from the movie Jurassic Park, accurately
                    describes what we have done with Botomir. For me working on this project has
                    been an awesome way to work on writing more modular code, and <b>willingly</b> work
                    with a friend on a project that the University is not forcing us to do.
