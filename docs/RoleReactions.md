## Role Reactions

Many servers choose to have roles that are assigned upon a user reacting to a message. You can set this up for your 
server using Botomir.

### Set Role Channel

You must specify a role channel for Botomir to generate its message.

Set a channel to which the message will be autogenerated to using the `set-role-channel` command.

### How to setup role reactions

First set a role channel. Then specify the message that members will see using the `set-roles` command. 

#### Example

```
User
> !set-role-channel #welcome

Botomir 
> Settings updated.

User
> !set-roles This is a really cool message about automated role assignment
>      
> ---
> :fire: : role A : a super cool role
> :waffle: : role B
```

### How to update role reactions

You can update this message by calling the `set-roles` command again with your new message and removing the old message. 

### Common errors

- The role name must be spelt exactly as it is set on your server
- You must include a space between the colons
- Botomir must have write permissions to the role channel
